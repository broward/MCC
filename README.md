Cloud Admin Client

This is a swing-based cloud admin client I wrote in 2011. It manages mBean components of a cloud network. This codebase was the first two weeks of work to demonstrate underlying technology ( JMX 2.0 ). There's a simple companion server which does the real work of aggregating and virtualizing mBean servers which I handed off to another team. Added to github as a resume code sample, there's no relevant proprietary information in it.

This was the only worthwhile thing I wrote in 2011 and it was only a few weeks. :)

A recreation of the server component is here - https://github.com/broward/Kmon
